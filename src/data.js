Turkish Bath which Turks brought with them when they came to Anatolia, has a history longer than 400 years. Bath has been a part of our traditional culture since that time. Part of the experience of a Turkish bath is a sauna, body scrub and soft soap massage, all to make your skin feel fresh and soft and you completely relaxed. You will feel the oxygen into your cells after bath. If you want a ladies day is also available.",
